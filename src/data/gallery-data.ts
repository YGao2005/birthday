My birthday was the first time we ate with my family together, and I had such a fun day taking her around my hometown and showing her my favorite places. KCN/TCN was the first time I got to saw her perform, and it was one of the coolest moments of my life. Also her performance outfits are 10000/10 definitely show-stoppers.",

One of my fav photos (the churro one) is from this album, and I had such a blast going on all the rides with her. I hadn't been to Disney in years (I forgot everything), and I'm so happy I get to relive the memories with her. I really want to go visit Orlando so we can visit the other parks! Hopefully we'll have more photos to add here soon :) ",
